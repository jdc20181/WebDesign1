Stuff for my class. 

#About 

This is for my WebDesign 1 course for highschool, but since I have been coding longer and way past this kind of material I decided to build a dedicated respo for my teacher - 

You can see the material [here](https://jdc20181.github.io/WebDesign1/)

The course only required to cover 1900-1999 so anything of modern age e.g.  Iphone's isn't really mentioned. 

Bugs, suggestions, typos etc can be reported/sent via Github issues. 

The Site demonstrates:

 - Web Safe Colors
 
 - Responsive Design 
 
 - Simple UI (But stylish!)
 
 - How to present information 
  
 - How information can be presented on a website. 

#Changes

Changes will come throughout the course as I will be adding images, as well as other information I am sure, down the road. I am only on Module 2 of the course and there are several more before I complete the course. 

Even after I complete the course this will remain up as a source of information - It took several hours on each time period to get summaries of the information presented. A better design, and maybe a 1-page based site could be coming in the future. 

PR will be accepted but must be effecient to approve. As this is for school.
