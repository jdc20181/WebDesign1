Stuff for my class. 

#About 

This is for my WebDesign 1 course for highschool, but since I have been coding longer and way past this kind of material I decided to build a dedicated respo for my teacher - 

You can see the material [here](https://jdc20181.github.io/WebDesign1/)

The course only required to cover 1900-1999 so anything of modern age e.g.  Iphone's isn't really mentioned. 

Bugs, suggestions, typos etc can be reported/sent via Github issues.
